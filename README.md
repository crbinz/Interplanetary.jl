# Interplanetary.jl

A collection of code for low-fidelity interplanetary navigation and guidance modeling and simulation. It was developed for the ENAE741 at the University of Maryland. It's not exactly in a complete state, so I'm leaving it unregistered for now.

## Usage
Most functions should be at least minimally documented; some familiarity with the concepts of interplanetary astrodynamics will be helpful.

## Examples
Examples are in the `examples/` directory. They can be run inside the directory with `include("<example name>.jl")`.
